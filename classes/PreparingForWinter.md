# Discussion Questions: Preparing for Winter

## Level 1: Remembering
- What were the primary goals of the Allied powers (United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union) at the Yalta Conference?
- Who delivered the "Iron Curtain" speech, and what was its main message?
- What were the main areas of influence established in Europe after World War II, as shown on the map?

## Level 2: Understanding
- How did the agreements at Yalta and Potsdam reflect the differing priorities of the Allied powers?
- Why did Winston Churchill describe the Soviet sphere as an "Iron Curtain"?
- What role did geographic location play in the division of influence in postwar Europe?

## Level 3: Applying
- If you were representing the Soviet Union, how would you justify creating a buffer zone in Eastern Europe?
- How might the outcomes of the negotiations at Yalta and Potsdam have differed if the Soviet Union had not joined the war against Japan?
- Using the map, design a hypothetical plan for neutralizing tensions between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union over Germany.

## Level 4: Analyzing
- What compromises were made between the Allied powers at Yalta and Potsdam, and how did these compromises favor or disadvantage specific nations?
- How did the "Iron Curtain" speech influence Western policies toward the Soviet Union during the early Cold War?
- Analyze the map: Which areas of influence might have been the most contested, and why?

## Level 6: Evaluating
- Was the division of Europe after WWII inevitable, or could the Allied powers have negotiated a more unified approach?
- Evaluate the long-term consequences of the agreements at Yalta and Potsdam on the NATO-Warsaw Pact divide. Were these agreements fair?
- To what extent did the "Iron Curtain" speech accurately predict the geopolitical realities of the Cold War?
