Code War: Cold War History through Game Modding
In this course, students will delve into Cold War history by transforming the video game ‘Command and Conquer: Red Alert’ into a simulation that captures the strategic dynamics of the era. We’ll research key developments in cold war and apply our findings through game modding: adjusting game dynamics with YAML files and C#, designing maps that recreate historic battle sites, reverse engineering opponent capabilities with Ghidra, and using large language models to role-play diplomats, spies, and war correspondents. Whether you’re drawn to historical research, coding, reverse engineering, AI integration, or LAN-based gaming, this course offers a unique blend of historical insight and technical skill-building.
